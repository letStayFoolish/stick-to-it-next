## User Flow

1. **Browse Categories:**

    - Users start on the Categories Page where they can browse all available categories.

2. **View Products:**

    - By clicking on a category, users are redirected to `categories/:id` where they can see all products within that
      category.

3. **Add Products:**

    - Users add products to their list by clicking the "Add" button next to each product.
    - Upon clicking "Add", options for adjusting the quantity, the unit of measure (UOM), and an increase/decrease
      button are displayed.
    - After selecting the desired quantity and UOM, users confirm their choice by clicking the green check mark to add
      items to their shopping list.

4. **Manage Shopping List:**

    - The List Page displays all items users have added. Here, users can modify quantities, change the UOM, mark items
      as checked, delete products, or clear the entire list.

5. **User Registration and Login:**
    - To add or manage items in the shopping list, users must register or log in.
